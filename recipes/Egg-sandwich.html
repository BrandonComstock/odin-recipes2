<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Scramble 2-4 eggs in a bowl, put salt and pepper. Heat up pan and add fat of your choice 
    (I personally love coconut oil). Have 2 pieces of bread toasting in the meantime.

    On medium heat then pour in egg mixture, put the 2 pieces of bread in the pan and flip them over so both sides are covered in egg.
    wait for eggs to cook until its no longer liquid, then flip the entire thing. Fold in sides of the egg so sandwich is uniform, then add 
    optional stuff like cheese, green onion, bacon, ham, whatever. Flip bread onto other side so its now upright and let sit for a bit. Turn off the heat then flip over, and serve.
