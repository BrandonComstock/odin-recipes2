<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Take half of a cup of oats, a scoop or 2 of flavored protein powder, pinch of salt, and a cup of water and mix in a bowl.
    Microwave for 1 minute and twenty seconds, then take out and let cool.

    Now add some toppings! I really like to add peanut butter, if the oatmeal is still warm it will melt the peanut butter and make
    it have a nice texture. I also like to add frozen fruits like blueberries and strawberries. Then I like to add vanilla greek yogurt, some cut up bananas,
    and if im feeling extra crazy a little drizzle of honey on top.
