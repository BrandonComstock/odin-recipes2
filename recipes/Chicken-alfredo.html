<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Cut up 2-4 chicken breasts and start cooking them in a pan. Boil pasta of your choice while doing this (I'm a fan of penne myself).
    Cut up some mushrooms and cook them in another pan (or air fry them).

    After chicken and pasts is done set them aside, take pan that had pasta and pour in alfredo sauce and let it warm up. Then put in cooked chicken
    and cooked mushrooms and pasta and mix it around. Pour on some parsley and serve.
